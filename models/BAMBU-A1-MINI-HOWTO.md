# Print support for the Bambu Labs A1 Mini

The print profile of the original Octolamp has been scaled down to 80% in order to fit comfortably on the build plate of the A1 Mini. The [octolamp-A1mini.3mf](octolamp-A1mini.3mf) file is a pre-sliced file that can be loaded directly into the A1 Mini. The print configuration currently includes three plates, one for each component. The profile also assumes the use of the AMS Lite for multi-color spooling but could easily be adapted for single-color printing or single-spool printing with filament switching when required.
